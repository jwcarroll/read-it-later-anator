# User Preferences Memory

Capture durable behavioral preferences learned from user corrections.

## Preferences
1. Always plan with a written specification before implementation.
2. Every specification must include business value and testable acceptance criteria.
3. Units of work should be as small as possible while still delivering user value (lean iteration).
4. Ask clarifying questions before implementation; do not assume details.
5. Use sub-agents whenever possible to keep context clean.
6. Self-document behavioral corrections so future sessions improve.

## Update Rule
When the user corrects behavior:
- Add the correction as a new preference or revise an existing one.
- Reference related spec/commit/PR when possible.
