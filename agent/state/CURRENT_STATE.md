# Current State

## Project Snapshot
- **Current Phase**: Planning and documentation bootstrap
- **Last Completed Iteration**: Repository architecture/design docs authored
- **Active Branch**: work

## Latest Completed Work
- Added agent workflow framework (`AGENTS.md`, playbook, templates, and state files).
- Established mandatory spec-first + clarification gate before implementation.
- Added lean iteration loop with SVI requirement and evidence-based validation.

## Next Recommended Iteration
1. Create first active spec in `agent/specs/` for the highest-priority product slice.
2. Ask clarifying questions and confirm assumptions.
3. Implement only the approved SVI.

## Open Risks / Blockers
- No implementation code scaffold exists yet (backend/frontend directories are still planned only).
- Product scope could expand without strict SVI discipline.

## Resume Checklist
- Read this file.
- Review `agent/state/PREFERENCES.md`.
- Open newest file in `agent/specs/`.
- Continue from unresolved clarifications first.
